# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Aligned conditional guidance with the current syntax: `if / else if / else` is supported, legacy `elif` is not, and Agentforce lint rejects true nested conditionals; the detailed syntax now has one canonical section.
- Separated AgentScript control from model-facing instructions: the compiler and runtime select execution blocks and resolve variables and control flow, while portable model instructions state concrete operating duties rather than assuming structured subagent identity or direct variable access.
- Made new-agent guidance history-first: focused domains start as one execution block with no router, ordinary conversational continuity stays in surviving history, and persistent controls require a named writer, consumer, reset/expiry, correction behavior, and cancellation path.
- Standardized new AgentScript examples on 4-space structural indentation. The installed Python hook now describes its regex checks as local preflight rather than parser/compiler validation; authoritative language validation uses the AgentScript SDK or Salesforce CLI.
- Made all 24 shipped `.agent` assets compile with zero error or warning
  diagnostics under the open-source `@agentscript/agentforce` SDK 2.9.27
  parse/lint/compile pipeline, removed a superseded template, corrected
  lifecycle and callback examples, and added version-gated SDK validation with
  a native Node validator available through the public
  `@sf-agentscript/agentforce` package and a build-from-source fallback, without
  adding a skill-runtime dependency. The validator reports informational
  diagnostics separately.
  Model-facing system instructions now state concrete branch-compatible duties
  without naming AgentScript instruction surfaces.

### Added
- **Known issue #18 resolved** — the `connection customer_web_client:` DSL block (underscores) compiles a `CustomerWebClient` plannerSurface directly, so voice/ECv2 agents no longer need the 6-step post-publish patch. Verified against `storm`: the published `GenAiPlannerBundle` contains both `Messaging` and `CustomerWebClient` surfaces auto-generated from the DSL. The original failure used the non-existent `connection customerwebclient:` spelling (no underscores). `known-issues.md` Issue 18 marked RESOLVED; patch workflow retained as historical fallback. ([#39](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc/pull/39))

- Voice modality support across all ADLC skills — `/agentforce-generate` now detects voice agent intent, includes `modality voice:` and `language:` blocks, and generates voice-optimized instructions; `/agentforce-test` adds voice UX checks (response length, formatting, confirmation patterns); `/agentforce-observe` flags voice-specific anti-patterns in session analysis.
- `skills/agentforce-generate/references/voice-modality-reference.md` — full `modality voice:` block syntax, properties (TTS speed/stability/similarity, STT filler detection, pronunciation dict, speak-up/endpointing config), and voice-specific authoring guidance.
- `skills/agentforce-generate/assets/agents/voice-service-agent.agent` — example voice agent template with `modality voice:`, `VoiceCallId` linked variable (`@VoiceCall.Id`), `connection messaging:` + `connection customer_web_client:`, and telephony-optimized instructions.
- Voice authoring starts from the platform default voice (`UgBBYS2sOqTuMpoF3BR0`, speed 1 / stability 0.65 / similarity 0.75) rather than prompting for a `voice_id`; the skill points users to Agent Builder → Connections → Voice to customize.
- "voice agent" and "phone agent" trigger phrases for `/agentforce-generate`.
- `skills/agentforce-generate/assets/agents/voice-knowledge-grounded.agent` — combined template pairing `modality voice:` + voice wiring with a `knowledge:` block and `AnswerQuestionsWithKnowledge` action, with spoken-answer anti-hallucination guards. Aligns with Project Codey "Steel Thread 2" (Voice-Enabled Agent with Knowledge Grounding). `/agentforce-generate` now proactively asks the Knowledge Grounding question when it detects a voice agent (voice service agents are almost always FAQ/policy-backed) and starts from this template when the Spec has both Voice and Knowledge sections.
- Voice reference now documents the known limitation that deploy-to-voice-channel is UI-only (`sf agent publish` deploys the bundle, but wiring to a telephony channel requires Agent Builder → Connections → Voice → Continue) — a tracked Steel Thread 2 gap — plus a Steel Thread alignment note.
- "Optimize an Agent" task domain in `/agentforce-generate` — scans `.agent` files for 4 optimization patterns (data flow wiring, deterministic logic extraction, reference syntax fixes, escalation action wiring) and applies fixes with user approval. Ported from A2 `optimize-agent` skill. ([#36](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc/pull/36))
- 4 optimization pattern reference files: `optimization-pattern-1-data-flow.md`, `optimization-pattern-2-deterministic-logic.md`, `optimization-pattern-3-reference-syntax.md`, `optimization-pattern-4-escalation.md`.
- Trigger phrases for optimization: "optimize agent", "improve agent", "clean up agent", "refactor agent".
- One-`@InvocableMethod`-per-Apex-class rule made explicit in `/agentforce-generate` — the `apex://` target convention is `apex://ClassName` (one class per action, no `.method` suffix). Salesforce forbids multiple `@InvocableMethod`s per class, so distinct Apex actions must use distinct classes. `agent-validator.py` now flags multiple `apex://` targets sharing a class name.

### Changed
- Voice connection guidance corrected per PR #39 review — `connection customer_web_client:` (Enhanced Chat v2 / ECv2) is the voice-capable surface; `connection messaging:` is **additive**, needed only when the agent escalates to a human (`@utils.escalate`). Previously the docs/templates implied messaging was always required for voice. Clarified the `modality`↔`connection` relationship and how ECv2 vs Telephony (Service Cloud Voice) relate. ([#39](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc/pull/39))
- `actions-reference.md` "Supported Channels" table now lists `customer_web_client` alongside `messaging` and `telephony`, resolving a repo self-contradiction (the surface type appeared only in the voice reference before).
- Voice starter templates (`voice-service-agent.agent`, `voice-knowledge-grounded.agent`) trimmed to the **minimum** `modality voice:` block (voice_id + speed/stability/similarity). Advanced settings (filler-word detection, speak-up, endpointing) moved to opt-in guidance in the voice reference. Spoken-delivery instructions trimmed to the high-value guards (read back critical data; never speak URLs/citations/formatting) rather than restating tone the planner already handles.
- `/agentforce-test` voice-testing section reframed as **heuristic text-preview proxy checks**, not native voice validation — the CLI has no audio/TTS/STT testing; true voice test generation depends on the out-of-scope NGT API.
- Softened the `apex://` "won't compile" claim in `agent-design-and-spec-creation.md` — the verified failure is the **shared class** (`Only one method per type can be defined with: InvocableMethod`); whether the `.method` suffix string itself breaks resolution is not independently confirmed.
- Skill `metadata.version` bumped for the voice + review changes: `agentforce-generate` 0.9→0.10, `agentforce-test` 0.6→0.7, `agentforce-observe` 0.6→0.7. Plugin version bumped 0.9.0→0.10.0 in both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`. ([#39](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc/pull/39))

### Fixed
- Fixed `apex://Class.method` method-suffix targets in the repo's own files that tripped the new validator: `voice-service-agent.agent`, `examples.md`, `lifecycle-events.agent` (×2), `action-callbacks.agent`. ([#39](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc/pull/39))
- `agent-validator.py` `_check_apex_target_shared_class()` now skips `#` comment lines, so a `# see apex://Foo.bar` note no longer emits a false method-suffix warning.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-28

### Added
- New skill: `/agentforce-secure` — OWASP LLM Top 10 security assessment for live Agentforce agents. Sends 57 adversarial test payloads across 7 categories (Prompt Injection, Sensitive Info Disclosure, Output Handling, Excessive Agency, System Prompt Leakage, Misinformation, Unbounded Consumption) via `sf agent preview`, evaluates all responses via LLM-as-judge (Claude Code), and produces a severity-weighted A–F grade.
- `scripts/security_runner.py` — Reusable test executor: loads YAML payloads, manages preview sessions, sends adversarial utterances, collects responses. No built-in judging — all evaluation done by Claude Code as LLM-as-judge.
- `scripts/security_scoring.py` — Weighted severity scoring calculator (A–F grading).
- `skills/agentforce-secure/assets/payloads/` — 7 YAML payload files with adapted test cases.
- `skills/agentforce-secure/references/` — 5 reference docs (owasp-categories, scoring-methodology, dynamic-test-generation, remediation-guide, troubleshooting).
- Cross-references from `/agentforce-test` (safety verdict section) and agent definitions to the new skill.
- Backward compatibility aliases: `/adlc-security`, `/agentforce-security`, `/owasp-scan`.

- KNOWLEDGE (Knowledge Article Library) and RETRIEVER (Custom Retriever Library) source type support in `data-library-reference.md`, completing all three ADL source types.
- `org-setup-for-adl.md` — fresh org configuration reference (platform settings, admin permsets, Knowledge enablement, agent-user runtime perms, language alignment).
- Anti-hallucination guard instruction fix in `knowledge-grounded.agent` — "ALWAYS call the action FIRST" now precedes the empty-check, preventing planner short-circuit.

### Changed
- **BREAKING** — All four skills renamed from the `{verb}-agentforce` suffix scheme to the `agentforce-{verb}` prefix scheme, aligning with the Salesforce internal `sf-skills` naming convention: `developing-agentforce` → `agentforce-generate`, `testing-agentforce` → `agentforce-test`, `observing-agentforce` → `agentforce-observe`, `securing-agentforce` → `agentforce-secure`. The old names remain registered as backward-compatible aliases (see Migration). The file-copy installer (`tools/install.py`) now matches managed skills by exact name and prunes the legacy directories on upgrade, so existing installs are cleaned up automatically without touching unrelated `agentforce-*` skills.
- `adlc-orchestrator.md` — Added Phase 7 (Security Assessment) and success criterion for Grade B+.
- `adlc-qa.md` — Added `agentforce-secure` to skills list and security assessment workflow section.
- Skill `metadata.version` fields normalized to the `x.y` format required by the Salesforce skill validator (was `x.y.z`) and bumped: `agentforce-generate` 0.7.0→0.8, `agentforce-test` 0.5.1→0.6, `agentforce-observe` 0.5.1→0.6; `agentforce-secure` normalized 0.1.0→0.1.
- Plugin version bumped to 0.9.0 (picks up the new skill versions and the rename).

- All ADL operations now use `sf agent adl` CLI commands exclusively. Removed raw Connect API paths, OpenAPI spec (`adl-api-spec.yaml`), and curl-based Appendix.
- `SKILL.md` ADL orchestration steps updated to reference CLI commands (`sf agent adl list`, `sf agent adl create`, `sf agent adl get`) instead of REST endpoints.
- Permission prerequisites expanded into 4 sub-sections (DC permset, Knowledge FLS, language alignment, Data Space scope) with deploy examples.
- Added "inspect file content" instruction — skill should read the PDF, not ask the user to describe it.

### Removed
- `assets/adl-api-spec.yaml` — 941-line OpenAPI spec replaced by CLI command reference.

### Migration
The four skill commands were renamed. The old names still resolve via aliases, so existing invocations keep working — but new work should use the `agentforce-*` names:

| Old command | New command |
|---|---|
| `/developing-agentforce` | `/agentforce-generate` |
| `/testing-agentforce` | `/agentforce-test` |
| `/observing-agentforce` | `/agentforce-observe` |
| `/securing-agentforce` | `/agentforce-secure` |

**Plugin users** — update to pick up the renamed skills:
```bash
claude plugin update agentforce-adlc@agentforce-adlc
```

**File-copy users** — re-run the installer; it removes the old skill directories and installs the renamed ones automatically:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/adlc-install.py --update
```

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-19

### Changed
- `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect the new plugin slug (`agentforce-adlc`) in install commands, skill namespace examples (`/agentforce-adlc:developing-agentforce`, etc.), and project-structure references.
- `/developing-agentforce` now prompts the user during agent authoring (after Spec approval, before code generation) about whether to ground the agent on a document corpus. If yes, the skill provisions a SFDRIVE Agentforce Data Library via the Einstein Data Libraries REST API and writes the `knowledge:` block + `AnswerQuestionsWithKnowledge` action into the first authored `.agent`. Includes a Data Cloud preflight (`SELECT COUNT() FROM DataKnowledgeSpace` + `GET /einstein/data-libraries` health check) with an A/B branch when DC is not provisioned and a distinct "DC up, ADL service broken" path.
- Skill responsiveness improvements based on the test-agent16 session:
  - ADL readiness now keys on `retrieverId` populating, not the lagging top-level `indexingStatus.status` flag (which can stay `IN_PROGRESS` for 10–30 minutes after the retriever is live).
  - Data Cloud preflight rewritten: primary check is `SELECT COUNT() FROM DataKnowledgeSpace` (the actual ADL pipeline dependency, queryable as soon as DC provisioning completes — pattern adopted from codey-cko2's `setting-up-help-agent`). Secondary check is `GET /einstein/data-libraries` to validate ADL service health. Replaces the prior `DataStream__dlm` query, which produced false-negatives on healthy DC orgs (verified across arc6 / arc2 / arc7).
  - Knowledge-grounded subagent now ships with an anti-hallucination guard: when `knowledgeSummary` is empty, the agent must refuse rather than compose. Also documented in the Wiring section of the Data Library reference.
  - The publish-500 quick-reference is now a four-cause triage (agent-type mismatch, missing `outputs:`, structural drift via diff-against-working-bundle, transient backend) rather than a single-cause hint.
  - New Rule 5 ("Don't stall") in `Rules That Always Apply` codifies that the skill should announce and start the next step automatically rather than waiting for "what's next?" prompts.
- Skill responsiveness improvements based on the test-agent17 session:
  - **ADL provisioning kicks off earlier.** The grounding question (and file-path capture) now lives inside the Design step (Step 1) of the "Create an Agent" workflow, so it gets surfaced during requirements gathering rather than post-Spec-approval. Provisioning starts in Step 3 (environment validation) and runs in the background through bundle generation, code authoring, and validation. By Step 8 (Validate behavior), `retrieverId` has typically populated. Same shape applied to "Modify an Existing Agent" (grounding question moves into Step 2 Update Agent Spec; provisioning kickoff into Step 4).
  - **Pre-publish permset audit added to Step 8 CHECKPOINT.** When the agent has a `knowledge:` block, the skill now verifies the Einstein Agent User has a Data Cloud permset/PSL assigned (one of `GenieDataPlatformStarterPsl` PSL, `GenieUserEnhancedSecurity` PS, `DataCloudUser` PS, or `DataCloudArchitect` PS) before allowing Publish. Without this, `AnswerQuestionsWithKnowledge` returns empty `knowledgeSummary` at runtime and the anti-hallucination guard refuses every utterance — caught by the user in test-agent17 instead of by the skill.
  - **New Step 3b in `agent-user-setup.md`** — discovery-then-assign procedure for the Data Cloud permset, with PSL and PS branches, post-assignment verification queries, and a Data Space scope manual fallback (UI-only — no API exists). The permset name is **not** hardcoded; the skill discovers which name exists in the org. Pattern informed by codey-cko2's `assigning-permission-sets` skill.
  - `data-library-reference.md` now documents the permission prerequisite in the Wiring section, and the "Common pitfalls" list calls out the empty-`knowledgeSummary` symptom for ADL-permission failures.
- `skills/developing-agentforce/assets/` reorganized ([#15](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc/pull/15)) — relocated four templates that ARE referenced from `SKILL.md` / `agents/adlc-author.md` into `assets/agents/` so all complete-agent templates live in one place: `template-single-subagent.agent`, `template-multi-subagent.agent`, `local-info-agent-annotated.agent`, `hub-and-spoke.agent`. Updated `SKILL.md`, both READMEs, and `agents/adlc-author.md` to match; fixed a pre-existing stale `multi-topic.agent` reference (actual file is `multi-subagent.agent`). End-state top level is 4 starter files (`adl-api-spec.yaml`, `agent-spec-template.md`, `bundle-meta.xml`, `invocable-apex-template.cls`) plus `agents/` and `patterns/`.

### Added
- This `CHANGELOG.md`, plus a version-and-changelog workflow section in `CLAUDE.md`.
- `skills/developing-agentforce/references/data-library-reference.md` — full ADL provisioning flow (Steps 0–8) and Agent Script wiring guide (`knowledge:` block + `AnswerQuestionsWithKnowledge` action).
- `skills/developing-agentforce/assets/agents/knowledge-grounded.agent` — minimal copy-modify template demonstrating the wiring.
- `skills/developing-agentforce/assets/adl-api-spec.yaml` — ADL OpenAPI spec, used by the optional spec-validation appendix.

### Removed
- `skills/adl/` — folded into `/developing-agentforce`. Users who invoked the standalone skill should now use `/developing-agentforce` for end-to-end agent + ADL authoring.
- `skills/developing-agentforce/assets/` v1 debt ([#15](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc/pull/15)) — pruned 9 orphan files and 3 unused subdirectories (`apex/`, `components/`, `metadata/`) left over from the v1→v2 transition. None had live references in `SKILL.md`, reference docs, scripts, or hooks. Removed: `README-legacy.md`, `deterministic-routing.agent`, `escalation-pattern.agent`, `flow-action-lookup.agent`, `minimal-starter.agent`, `prompt-rag-search.agent`, and an older 208-line duplicate of `verification-gate.agent` (the canonical 280-line copy lives under `assets/agents/`).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-01

### Changed
- **BREAKING** — Plugin slug renamed from `adlc` to `agentforce-adlc` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` ([#9](https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/agentforce-adlc/pull/9)).

### Migration
Existing users must uninstall the old plugin and install under the new slug:
```bash
claude plugin uninstall adlc@agentforce-adlc
claude plugin install agentforce-adlc@agentforce-adlc
```
Skill invocations change from `/adlc:<skill>` to `/agentforce-adlc:<skill>`.

## [0.5.0] — Initial release

### Added
- Three consolidated skills: `developing-agentforce`, `testing-agentforce`, `observing-agentforce`.
- Four agents: `adlc-orchestrator`, `adlc-author`, `adlc-engineer`, `adlc-qa`.
- PreToolUse / PostToolUse hooks: `guardrails.py`, `agent-validator.py`.
- Discover / scaffold / deploy Python helpers under `scripts/`.
- File-copy installer (`tools/install.py`) for Cursor and legacy Claude Code.
- pytest test suite under `tests/`.
